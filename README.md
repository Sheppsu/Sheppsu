### Welcome to my profile

I have been programming since around 2017, and am mostly self-taught.

The first programming language I learned was **Python**, which I still use today the most. I like Python because it makes it easy to explore various areas of programing.

For about two years I also used **Lua** in making Roblox games (around 2017-2019).

I took an AP CS class in which I used **Java** for two school semesters, though I haven't done much else with it.

I've used **C#** several times in various random projects, so I have a bit of experience with it.

I know basic **SQL** from working with databases like sqlite and mysql in various projects.

I've done a good bit of website development for several projects, so I have good experience with **html**, **css** and **web javascript**. Some examples are https://oct.sheppsu.me, https://bot.sheppsu.me, and https://sheppsu.me

I started using **C** around early 2023 and have fun using it in various projects. I used it in my [beatmap_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/beatmap_reader) project, but the C code in that project is a bit old and doesn't showcase my current competence with the language.

### Activity

I usually just work on whatever I feel like and I learn something new every time.

Projects I'm currently working on:
 - [oct-site](https://github.com/Sheppsu/oct-site), a site for a tournament I host called Offline Chat Tournament. URL for the site is https://oct.shepppsu.me
 - [osu.py](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py), a Python api wrapper for osu! api v2.
 - [Offline chat bot](https://github.com/Sheepposu/offlinechatbot), a Python twitch bot that runs in a few offline chats.
 - [Offline chat bot site](https://github.com/Sheepposu/offlinechatbot-site), the site for offline chat bot. Has docs and other fun stuff.
 - [discord.py audio receive branch](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py/pull/9288) the PR explains itself

Projects I'm no longer working on, finished, on hold, or don't need much maintenance:
 - I have a bunch of random minor projects I worked on you can just scroll through my repositories.
 - [sdvx_memory_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/sdvx_memory_reader), contains Python libraries and programs for reading sdvx virtual memory data and doing stuff with it, such as making a Discord rich presence.
 - [AMQ-7TV-Chat](https://github.com/Sheppsu/AMQ-7TV-Chat), a tapermonkey script that adds 7TV emotes to AMQ chat.
 - [beatmap_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/beatmap_reader), a Python library for reading beatmaps that's working but not complete.
 - [osu_diff_calc](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu_diff_calc), a Python library for calculating difficulty and performance point values of a beatmap.
 - I recently reopened this old [PR](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/pull/9288) that adds voice receive support to discord.py. I rewrote my old shitty code from a couple years ago and I plan to actively keep the code up to date now.
