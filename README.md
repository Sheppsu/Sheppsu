### Welcome to my profile

I have been programming since around 2017, and am self-taught.
My most used languages are Python and Lua. I've used a lot of Lua in making Roblox games and Python to explore various areas of programming.

I know a decent amount of css, html, Java, and little bit of Javascript and SQL.

I usually just work on whatever I feel like and I learn something new every time.

[Public projects I'm currently working on](https://github.com/stars/Sheepposu/lists/current-projects):
 - [osu.py](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py), a Python api wrapper for osu! api v2.
 - [Offline chat bot](https://github.com/Sheepposu/offlinechatbot), a Python twitch bot that runs in a few offline chats.
 - [beatmap_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/beatmap_reader), a Python library for reading beatmaps that's working but not complete.
