### Welcome to my profile

I have been programming since around 2017, and am mostly self-taught.

The first programming language I learned was **Python**, which I still use today the most. I like Python because it makes it easy to explore various areas of programing.

For about two years I also use **Lua** in making Roblox games.

I took an AP CS class in which I used **Java** for two school semesters, though I haven't done much else with it.

I've used **C#** several times in various random projects, so I have a bit of experience with it.

I know basic **SQL** from working with databases like sqlite and mysql in various projects.

I've done a good bit of website development for several projects, so I have a decent amount of experience with **html**, **css** and **web javascript**. 

More recently I started delving into **C**, which has been fun, and I'm even using it in my [beatmap_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/beatmap_reader) project!

### Activity

I usually just work on whatever I feel like and I learn something new every time.

Public projects I'm currently working on:
 - [osu.py](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py), a Python api wrapper for osu! api v2.
 - [Offline chat bot](https://github.com/Sheepposu/offlinechatbot), a Python twitch bot that runs in a few offline chats.
 - [Offline chat bot site](https://github.com/Sheepposu/offlinechatbot-site), the site for offline chat bot. Has docs and other fun stuff.
 - [beatmap_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/beatmap_reader), a Python library for reading beatmaps that's working but not complete.
 - [osu_diff_calc](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu_diff_calc), a Python library for calculating difficulty and performance point values of a beatmap.
 - [sdvx_memory_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/sdvx_memory_reader), contains Python libraries and programs for reading sdvx virtual memory data and doing stuff with it, such as making a Discord rich presence.
 - I recently reopened this old [PR](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/pull/9288) that adds voice receive support to discord.py. I rewrote my old shitty code from a couple years ago and I plan to actively keep the code up to date now.

Past projects I'm no longer working on or finished:
 - I have a bunch of random minor projects I worked on you can just scroll through my repositories.
