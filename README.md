### Welcome to my profile

I'm a 19 year old college student and have been programming since around 2017 (mostly self-taught). I'm an undergrad majoring in statistics and data science (math emphasis).

My first language was python, which is still my main language, but I've used and still use a lot of other languages such as: C# (mostly on [osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu)), JS/TS (with HTML & CSS), SQL, C, and Rust. Honorable mentions: Lua (2 years with roblox), Java (1 year for AP CS).

My language of preference depends on the project and how I feel, but generally:
- I use python on large projects such as websites
- I use python or rust on small programs/projects
- I use rust or c for programs that require high-performance
- js/ts, html, css, and sql are mostly used in web projects

My favorites are definitely python and rust; python for the flexibility and easy-use, and rust for just being an awesome language.

### Activity

I usually just work on whatever I feel like and I like learning new things with each project.
