### Welcome to my profile

My birthday is October 3rd, 2005 (18 years old). I have been programming since around 2017, and am mostly self-taught.

The first programming language I learned was **Python**, which I still use today the most. I like Python because it makes it easy to explore various areas of programing and it's just a comfortable language to get things done.

For about two years, I also used **Lua** in making Roblox games (around 2017-2019).

I took an AP CS class in which I used **Java** for two school semesters, though I haven't done much else with it.

I've used **C#** several times in various random projects, so I have a bit of experience with it.

I know decent **SQL** from working with databases like sqlite and mysql in various projects.

I've done a good bit of website development for several projects, so I have good experience with **html**, **css** and **javascript/typescript**. Some examples are https://oct.sheppsu.me, https://bot.sheppsu.me, and https://sheppsu.me

I started using **C** around early 2023 and am utilizing it in some projects. I've most notably used it for my [sdvx_memory_reader](https://github.com/Sheppsu/sdvx_memory_reader) project.

I learned **Rust** aroun late 2023 and I love using it when I'm doing anything low-level or on small projects.

### Activity

I usually just work on whatever I feel like and I learn something new every time.

Projects I'm currently working on:
 - [oct-site](https://github.com/Sheppsu/oct-site), a site for a tournament I host called Offline Chat Tournament. URL for the site is https://oct.shepppsu.me
 - [osu.py](https://github.com/Sheppsu/osu.py), a Python api wrapper for osu! api v2.
 - [Offline chat bot](https://github.com/Sheppsu/offlinechatbot), a Python twitch bot that runs in a few offline chats.
 - [Offline chat bot site](https://github.com/Sheppsu/offlinechatbot-site), the site for offline chat bot. Has docs and other fun stuff.
 - [discord-ext-listening](https://github.com/Sheppsu/discord-ext-listening), voice receive extension for [discord.py](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py) built on multiprocessing and designed to be flexible.
 - [sdvx_memory_reader](https://github.com/Sheppsu/sdvx_memory_reader), C library for reading memory of sdvx exceed gear to get certain data. I'm currently adding more features to it. I also have [sdvx_rich_presence](https://github.com/Sheppsu/sdvx_rich_presence) which builds off of the memory reading library to implement a discord rich presence.

Projects I'm no longer working on, finished, on hold, or don't need much maintenance:
 - I have some other random minor projects I worked on you can just scroll through my repositories.
 - [AMQ-7TV-Chat](https://github.com/Sheppsu/AMQ-7TV-Chat), a tapermonkey script that adds 7TV emotes to AMQ chat.
 - [beatmap_reader](https://github.com/Sheppsu/beatmap_reader), a Python library for reading beatmaps that's working but not complete.
 - [osu_diff_calc](https://github.com/Sheppsu/osu_diff_calc), a Python library for calculating difficulty and performance point values of a beatmap.
 - [osu-score-tracker](https://github.com/Sheppsu/osu-score-tracker), Python programs for tracking scores and displaying them in website format (essentially a fresh profile of sorts).
 
Discord server for discussion/information about all my projects including future ones: https://discord.gg/uVmrN9zQ99 
 
I also play a lot of osu! - https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608 - as well as other rhythm games like sound voltex.
