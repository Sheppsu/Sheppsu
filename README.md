### Welcome to my profile

I have been programming since around 2017, and am self-taught.
My most used languages are Python and Lua. I've used a lot of Lua in making Roblox games and Python to explore various areas of programming.

I know a decent amount of css, html, Java, and little bit of Javascript and SQL.

I usually just work on whatever I feel like and I learn something new every time.

[Public projects I'm currently working on](https://github.com/stars/Sheepposu/lists/current-projects):
 - [osu.py](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py), an api wrapper for osu! api v2 made in Python.
 - [Offline chat bot](https://github.com/Sheepposu/offlinechatbot), a twitch bot that runs in the offline chat of [btmc](https://www.twitch.tv/btmc). Offline chat refers to the time when the streamer is offline.
 - [beatmap_reader](https://github.com/Sheepposu/beatmap_reader), a library for reading beatmaps that's still in the workings. I plan to add a star rating and pp calculator to it, add more parsing for certain things like hit sounds, and other general features that would make it a valuable library. 

[Past projects I'm no longer working on or finished](https://github.com/stars/Sheepposu/lists/past-projects):
 - I made [this pr](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/pull/6507) and though I never finished it, some others used it as a base to fully implement the feature such as [here](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/pull/224) and [here](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pull/532)
 - Made a cool [graph thingy](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu-graph) for osu!
 
I also play a lot of osu! - https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608 - as well as other rhythm games like sound voltex.
